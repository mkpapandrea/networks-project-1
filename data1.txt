In this project, you will implement a client and a server
which use UDP to transmit a file from the server to the client.

As you know, UDP does not provide reliable data transfer, whereas a user
transmitting a file would expect the file to be transferred reliably.
This project will not implement reliable data transfer, but we will build a
framework here which will be extended in Project 3 to achieve
reliable data transfer.

When the server starts, it waits for the client to send to it the name of the
file to be transferred. When the client starts, it prompts the user to enter a
filename and sends this name to the server. 
The server then reads the file and sends its contents to the client in a series
of packets as described below. The client receives the packets and
stores them in a file with the name {\it out.txt}. It also returns an ACK for
each packet it receives.

\begin{verbatim}
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                   Count (2 bytes)                    |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |           Packet Sequence Number (2 bytes)           |
    --------------------------------------------------------
    |                 Data (0 - 80 bytes)                  |
    --------------------------------------------------------
\end{verbatim}

The first field of the header is a count of the number of data characters in th
packet. This value must be in the range 0 through 80. If the count is 0, then x
there are no data characters in the packet. 
The second field of the header is called the
Packet Sequence Number. Each
packet transmitted by the server is assigned
a sequence number in the range 0 - 15.
